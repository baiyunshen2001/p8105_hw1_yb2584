# Problem 1
## 1.Set up

```{r setup,warning = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(moderndive)
```

## 2.Load data


```{r cars}
data("early_january_weather")
```

## 3.Describe data

First, let's see the first 20 lines of this data set

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
head(early_january_weather,20)
```

This data set recorded the weather of EWR in 2013 from Jan 1 to Jan 15.The variables include `r names(early_january_weather)`.This data set includes `r nrow(early_january_weather)` rows and `r ncol(early_january_weather)` columns.From this data set, the average temperature of EWR is `r mean(early_january_weather$temp)`. Therefore, we can conclude that EWR is very hot from January 1 to January 15.
